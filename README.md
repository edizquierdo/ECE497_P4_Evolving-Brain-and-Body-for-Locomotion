This is the starter code for Project #4. Here are the instructions. 

First, install PyBullet (Python-based physics engine).
- Windows users need to install Visual C++, so if you do not already have it, download and install: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
- Windows users also need to install or update wheel. Open a Command Prompt in Windows and type: pip3 install wheel
- Open a Command Prompt in Windows or Terminal on a Mac and type: pip3 install pybullet
- If you don't have pip3 or are not familiar with it, get it here: https://pypi.org/project/pip/
- If you have pip installed but pip3 is not recognized, try: py -m pip install pybullet

Second, download the code in this GitHub repository, which includes: 
- Two starter code files: generate.py and simulate.py
- Pyrosim package, which will allow us to more easily send information to pybullet, and get information back from it. Pyrosim stands for a [Py]thon [Ro]bot [Sim]ulator.

Third, make sure everything runs: 
- Run generate.py
- Run simulate.py

This should launch your Physics simulation. 
- You can look around your world by rotating the virtual camera.
a. For Windows users: just click and drag with the mouse. You can also hold the left control button down and move with the mouse, similar to the Mac users.
b. For Mac users: hold down CTRL, click and drag with a the mouse or press and drag on a trackpad.
- A two-fingered swipe on a trackpad, or rolling a mouse's scroll wheel, will move the position of the virtual camera.
- You can also manipulate the objects in the world. 
- You can "grab" the cube object that you create with your mouse and "throw" them by moving your mouse.
a. Windows users: Hold down SHIFT, click on the cube, and drag the mouse. You should see the cube, but not the virtual camera.
b. Mac users: Click on the cube and drag the mouse. You should see the cube, but not the virtual camera.
