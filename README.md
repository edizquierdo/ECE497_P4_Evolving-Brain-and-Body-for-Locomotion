This is the starter code for Project #4. Here are the instructions. 

First, install PyBullet (Python-based physics engine).
- Windows users need to install Visual C++, so if you do not already have it, download and install: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
- Windows users also need to install or update wheel. Open a Command Prompt in Windows and type: pip3 install wheel
- Open a Command Prompt in Windows or Terminal on a Mac and type: pip3 install pybullet
- If you don't have pip3 or are not familiar with it, get it here: https://pypi.org/project/pip/
- If you have pip installed but pip3 is not recognized, try: py -m pip install pybullet

Second, download the code in this GitHub repository, which includes: 
- Two starter code files: generate.py and simulate.py
- Pyrosim package, which will allow us to more easily send information to pybullet, and get information back from it. Pyrosim stands for a [Py]thon [Ro]bot [Sim]ulator.

Third, make sure everything runs: 
- Run generate.py
- Run simulate.py
